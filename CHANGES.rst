* Fix: On the import document dialog, rename 'Create' button into 'Add'
* Fix: For items displayed into the datatable, adjust the dropdown menu
  position based on page width.
* Fix: A name in CMIS can not ends with a dot. On the CMIS backend the
  'sanitize_cmis_name' method removes this character if it's found at the
  end of the string to sanitize and this case is detected by the method
  'is_valid_cmis_name'.

  that let's you perform CMIS actions on the forlder into the CMIS container.

  to have access to the preview of one document when filling the html form to
  copy/paste information from document into the form.
